# bigcartel-sass [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bigcartel/bigcartel-sass.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bigcartel/bigcartel-sass)

A standard set of variables, mixins, animations, and placeholder selectors to use across all of Big Cartel's front-end development.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'bigcartel-sass', github: 'bigcartel/bigcartel-sass'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Once installed, reference the library in your sass:

    @import 'bigcartel'
    
If you'd like to only include certain aspects of the library, you can import the parts directly -

    @import 'bigcartel/variables'
    @import 'bigcartel/mixins'
    @import 'bigcartel/placeholders'
